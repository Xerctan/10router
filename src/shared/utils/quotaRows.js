 *    scopes of the SAME resource, each a hard ceiling on the one inside it. A
 *    month's credits are doled out into weeks, which are doled out into 5h
 *    sessions. That is a true containment chain.
 *
 *  - antigravity: `Gemini · 5h Window` + `Gemini · Weekly Window` — two
 *    SEPARATE windows on the same family. Neither contains the other; both are
 *    independent meters that happen to share a name prefix. These must render
 *    as two side-by-side bars, NOT as a ladder.
 *
 *  - opencode-go: `Rolling` / `Weekly` / `Monthly` are each a PERCENT of its
 *    own undisclosed ceiling (all 100). The sizes of the ceilings relative to
 *    each other are unknown, so there is nothing to nest on — flat rows.
 *
 * So nesting requires a MONTHLY head AND real amounts on one scale: every
 * layer's ceiling must be strictly smaller than its parent's (commandcode
 * 3 < 6 < 10 USD). Otherwise this returns `[]` and the caller renders each row
 * as its own plain full-width bar.
 *
 * When nesting IS in play all layers share the HEAD's ceiling as the measure,
 * and a child's fill is clamped to its parent's — you cannot spend more of a
 * week than is left in the month:
 *
 *   月度额度 9.69/10  [███████████████████▍]  96.9%
 *     每周   5.69/6   [███████████▍        ]  56.9%
 *       滚动 2.73/3   [█████▍              ]  27.3%

 * Each row still reports its OWN `X / Y` in the label.
