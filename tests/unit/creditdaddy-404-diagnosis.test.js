// Issue #47: a reporter hit a permanent 404 on the ZCode Free line and was told
// nothing useful. Two separate causes, both pinned here:
//
//  1. CreditDaddy moved its gateway from /gateway/v1/messages to
//     /gateway/<brand>/v1/messages. 10Router has requested the branded path
//     since v1.3.3 (fbe43324), so the 404 comes from the gateway, not from our
//     URL building — and an old build still serving the bare endpoint 404s
//     forever.
//  2. The copy made that undiagnosable. A 404 was labelled "Model not found",
//     pointing at the user's model list instead of the path they configured.
