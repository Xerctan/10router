// search.js has no test file at all — handleSearch is not exercised anywhere in
// tests/ — so these are source-text guards, matching the repo convention for
// handler wiring that cannot be reached by importing (see
// tests/unit/disabled-models-ux.test.js:9).
//
// The invariant: a handler must use ONE lock key for all three touchpoints —
// credential resolution, the error lock, and the success clear. Mismatching them
// is silent and self-inflicted: markAccountUnavailable writes
// `modelLock_<model>`, and clearAccountError only nulls that same key, so a
// handler that locks with one key and clears with another leaves its own lock
// behind after a success. search.js already had the comment explaining why the
// key exists; it just wasn't passed to the clear.
